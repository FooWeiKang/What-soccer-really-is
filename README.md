# What-soccer-really-is
When I asked a friend of mine about the definition of soccer, he defined it as the fine art of using legs to knock a round and spherical shape in to a box. Players run around the field in a pointless 90 min duration before declaring one a winner as the loser go home in shame.
Is it though?
Let me tell you a brief history of soccer. Soccer, or football, is a team sport of 11 players on each team play together to see who can propel a soccer ball into the opponent's goal first. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.
According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju is the earliest form of football and was played at around the Han Dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD).
The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.

Soccer has been long defined as a "meaningless" and "aggressive" sport. 
Soocer has also been hated by some partially because it is a male-dominated sport, and females are not given much opportunity to play soccer.
Soccer has also been loved by some partially due to its carefree nature.
Personally, I feel that over the years, soccer has evolved from a recreational sport to a more competitive sport.
As a result, soccer is gaining more and more popularity, but also hatred.
As a soccer player myself, I have gained a lot from playing soccer.
From making new friends to keeping fit, soccer is the ultimate combination of virtues and fun.
Sportsmanship, teamwork, resilience, are virtues that one can never learn from a textbook, from a teacher.
One can only learn these virtues from playing the sport.
Soccer also bridges gaps between races, religion, genders, ages, and many more.
No matter who you are, where you come from, you can always enjoy a fun game of soccer.
